# BlinderFit Critical Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Build Error: "Could not load src/components/ui: EISDIR"**
   - **Problem**: In `vite.config.js`, the manual chunks configuration was trying to import the entire `components/ui` directory as a module, but it's a directory without an index file.
   - **Solution**: Removed the problematic line from `vite.config.js` that was creating a manual chunk for `ui`.
   - **File Changed**: `vite.config.js`
   - **Specific Change**: Replaced `ui: ['@/components/ui'],` with comments explaining the issue.

2. **Firebase Hosting Target Issue: "Hosting target blinderfit-live is linked to multiple sites"**
   - **Problem**: In `.firebaserc`, the target `blinderfit-live` was configured to use two sites (`blinderfit` and `blinderfit-live`), but a target can only be linked to one site.
   - **Solution**: Modified the `.firebaserc` file to use only `blinderfit-live` for the `blinderfit-live` target.
   - **File Changed**: `.firebaserc`
   - **Specific Change**: Removed `"blinderfit",` from the `blinderfit-live` target array.
