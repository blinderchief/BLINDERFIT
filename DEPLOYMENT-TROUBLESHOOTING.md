# Why Your Changes Aren't Showing on blinderfit.blinder.live

After investigating the deployment process, here are the likely reasons why your changes aren't being reflected on the live site:

## Possible Issues

### 1. Failed Build Process
The build process might not be completing successfully. When we run `npx vite build`, it starts but we don't see confirmation that it completes successfully.

### 2. Firebase CLI Issues
There may be issues with the Firebase CLI command execution. Commands like `firebase deploy` appear to start but don't show completion messages.

### 3. Firebase Authentication
You might not be properly authenticated with Firebase, or your account might not have the necessary permissions for deployment.

### 4. Firebase Hosting Configuration
The project's Firebase hosting configuration might not be correctly set up to target the blinderfit.blinder.live domain.

### 5. Caching Issues
Your browser might be caching the old version of the website. Try clearing your browser cache or viewing in an incognito/private window.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Deployment
Follow the steps in the MANUAL-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md file I've created. This provides step-by-step instructions for deploying manually.

### Option 2: Check Firebase Console
1. Log in to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select the "blinderfit" project
3. Go to "Hosting" section
4. Check if there are any recent deployments
5. If needed, you can deploy directly from the console by uploading the built files

### Option 3: Update Firebase CLI
1. Update the Firebase tools: `npm install -g firebase-tools@latest`
2. Log out and log back in: `firebase logout` then `firebase login`
3. Try deploying again

### Option 4: Verify Project Structure
Confirm that your project's dist folder contains all the necessary files after building, and that the firebase.json configuration correctly points to this folder.

## Next Steps

1. Try running the manual deployment steps
2. Check the Firebase Console for any error messages or logs
3. Verify your access permissions for the Firebase project
4. If you're still having issues, consider reaching out to Firebase support
