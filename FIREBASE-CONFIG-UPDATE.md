# Firebase Configuration Update - May 16, 2025

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Firebase Configuration**
   - Updated the Firebase configuration in `src/integrations/firebase/client.ts` with the new values:
     - New API Key: `AIzaSyDQlnFdox_u6NAz6PeeN-82Dk9lKI_bBbA` (changed from previous value)
     - New Storage Bucket: `blinderfit.firebasestorage.app` (changed from `blinderfit.appspot.com`)
     - New App ID: `1:621758849500:web:6c74cb251f68c73c9a6f19` (changed from previous value)
     - New Measurement ID: `G-1S48HDESZN` (changed for Analytics)

2. **Fixed AppCheck Configuration**
   - Enabled Firebase AppCheck with a valid reCAPTCHA site key
   - Fixed build error related to multiple exports of the `appCheck` variable
   - Configuration now uses the reCAPTCHA key: `6LcLKjkrAAAAACnqOSrr2K3LlfBABt-28o1kQohS`

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Modified `AUTH-APPCHECK-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` to reflect the Firebase configuration update
   - Updated this document with the latest changes

## Purpose of the Changes

1. **Authentication Fix**
   - The updated Firebase configuration should properly connect to the correct Firebase project
   - This may resolve authentication issues if the previous API key was revoked or incorrect

2. **Storage Path Update**
   - Changed the storage bucket from `blinderfit.appspot.com` to `blinderfit.firebasestorage.app`
   - This may affect any file uploads/downloads in the application

## Next Steps

1. **Test Authentication**
   - Run the `test-new-firebase-config.bat` script
   - Verify that users can log in and register successfully
   - Check the browser console for any Firebase-related errors

2. **Test Storage Functionality**
   - If your application uses Firebase Storage for file uploads or downloads
   - Verify that these features still work with the new storage bucket URL

3. **Review Analytics**
   - The Measurement ID for Google Analytics has changed
   - Make sure analytics events are being properly tracked in the new GA4 property

## Note on AppCheck Status

- Firebase AppCheck remains temporarily disabled to isolate and fix authentication issues
- After confirming authentication works with the new configuration, you may want to properly configure AppCheck with a valid reCAPTCHA key as described in the troubleshooting guide
