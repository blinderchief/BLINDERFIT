- Imported and used the Firebase `updateProfile` function to set user display names

## 3. Fixed Build System Issues
- Updated vite.config.js to increase chunk size warning limit
- Added manual chunking to improve build performance
- Separated vendor, Firebase, UI, and chart libraries into separate chunks

## 4. Fixed Firebase Deployment Configuration
- Updated the .firebaserc file with the correct target configurations
- Created improved deployment scripts with proper error handling
- Added fallback deployment methods for different hosting targets

## 5. Added Comprehensive Documentation
- Created MANUAL-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md with detailed deployment instructions
- Created DEPLOYMENT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md with common issues and solutions
- Added scripts to generate deployment packages for manual uploads

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

### 1. Code Splitting
For better performance, consider implementing code splitting using dynamic imports:
```js
// Example of dynamic import for a page
const MyZone = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/MyZone'));

// Then use with Suspense
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <MyZone />
</Suspense>
```

### 2. Firebase Authentication Enhancements
- Add password reset functionality
- Implement social login options (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Add email verification

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Implement server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG)
- Add caching strategies for Firebase data
- Optimize image loading with lazy loading

### 4. Error Handling
- Implement a global error boundary
- Add better error reporting to Firebase Analytics
- Create user-friendly error messages

### 5. Testing
- Add unit tests for components and functions
- Add integration tests for authentication flows
- Set up continuous integration (CI) to run tests automatically
